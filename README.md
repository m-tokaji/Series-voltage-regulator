# Series-voltage-regulator
This project contains the implementation of a series voltage regulator with certain design requirements. 


## Design requirements:

-Output tension adjustable in the interval of 13.5-27V

-Load of 1080 ohms

-Thermal drift of maximum 2mV/°

-Protection from overcurrent by limiting the current through the regulatig transistor to 0.5A

-Thermal protection of the series transistor to 120°C

-Input voltage in range 48.6-54V

-Open-loop voltage amplification of error amplifier of min. 100

-Signaling of input and output voltages by LEDs

-Operating domain 0-60°C


### The project also includes requirements for the physical implementation on PCB SMT technology:

-40x40mm board dimensions

-FR4 material,   18um copper layer, 1.6mm board thickness

-all components are TOP mounted

-SMD 0805 type component footprints

-16 mil signal traces. 

-1mm clearance from edge of board
